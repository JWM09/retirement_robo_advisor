UW Fintech Bootcamp Module 15 Challenge

---

## Technologies
  
This challenge had us using AWS Lex and Lambda to build a working investment advisor bot.    

---

## Purpose of Program

The main purpose of this project is to develop a basic understanding of the applications within the AWS ecosystem.

## Conclusions

I was able to generate a working bot as the video here shows

I was also able to write / update the Lambda code provided as python file and run the tests as required.  All tests passed as shown below

  ![incorrect_ammount](Images/incorrect_ammount_error.png)  
  
  ![negative_age](Images/negative_age_error.png)  
  
Unfortunately I was unable to get the bot and the lambda to communicate as the error below shows:  
  
  ![server_error](Images/server_error.png)  


I would like to note that this was an error that our substitute professor ran into as well and was unable to fix it during class time so, while I feel like I have followed all instructions to make this work, I have been unable to have it perform properly.
